# Prompt for LLM to Convert Markdown Question Files to LaTeX Book

I need you to convert several markdown question files into a complete LaTeX book for "The Ultimate Quest" quiz book. Use the existing LaTeX style files in the current folder (mcq_style.tex, section_cover.tex, and titlepage.tex) rather than creating new ones.

## Input Files
The source files are in the ./Question directory with names like "SCIENCE 400 questions.md", "ARTS 400 questions.md", etc. Each file has multiple sections marked with `**Section Title**` followed by numbered questions with lettered options.

## Expected Output
Generate a single LaTeX file that:
1. Maintains chapter organization based on the file names (SCIENCE, ARTS, etc.)
2. Preserves section titles from the markdown headings
3. Formats each question using the enhancedmcq environment
4. Collects all answers for the answer key section
5. Does not visually distinguish correct answers within questions
6. Ensures questions don't break across pages


## Complete Document Structure
Use the existing files and build a document with:
1. Proper front matter (titlepage, table of contents)
2. Section cover pages between major topics
3. Chapters and sections organized by topic
4. Answer key at the end

Please process all the files and generate the complete LaTeX document for compilation.
